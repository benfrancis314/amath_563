# amath_563
Code for AMATH 563 final project. 

Note that stored above is only code used for fine tuning and generating text from the models. The model bindaries are stored in my google drive, due to their large size (~1GB total). Contact the author for a google drive link to these models if you are interested. 

Also, sorry that the file is essentially madness right now. Finals pandemonium struck, and I would like to make a better holistic API for the process. 

The fragile beginning steps of such an API that can do the whole society process, which I am calling "WiseWorld" (after WestWorld) is also uploaded, though it doesn't fully work yet (I had previously done everything manually), so approach with absolute caution. 

In general, if anything isn't working contact the author at franc514@uw.edu. 

I am also planning on having a demo up soon at: 
cuddlefishproject.com

So, if you're interested give that a try as well, it may or may not be yet up. If it is, it should be loaded with the "tao" model, and is designed to be like a chatbot you can interact with. However, it will have no memory, like the models displayed in the paper.
