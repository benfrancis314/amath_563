# amath_563
Code for AMATH 563 final project. 

Note that stored above is only code used for fine tuning and generating text from the models. The model bindaries are stored in my google drive, due to their large size (~1GB total). Contact the author for a google drive link to these models if you are interested. 

Also, sorry that the file is essentially madness right now. Finals pandemonium struck, and I would like to make a better holistic API for the process. 

The fragile beginning steps of such an API that can do the whole society process, which I am calling "WiseWorld" (after WestWorld) is also uploaded, though it doesn't fully work yet (I had previously done everything manually), so approach with absolute caution.
